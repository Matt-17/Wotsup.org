# YAML Format

YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-friendly data serialization standard commonly used for configuration, data exchange, and declarative documents.

## Design Goals

- Readable by humans
- Supports rich data structures (lists, maps, scalars)
- Language agnostic

## Basic Example

```yaml
person:
  name: Alice
  age: 30
  languages:
    - English
    - French
```
