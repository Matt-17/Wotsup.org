## History and Origin

Wotsup.org builds on the foundation of the original Wotsit.org archive. From the mid-1990s through the 2000s, Wotsit.org — created by Paul Oliver and contributors worldwide — provided an essential collection of file format specifications and implementation notes. When that site went offline around 2009, an important body of knowledge became harder to access.

This project continues that legacy by preserving and modernizing the archive. We combine the original collection with community contributions and maintain an open, reviewable repository so formats remain discoverable and usable.

## Acknowledgments

We're grateful to Paul Oliver and the contributors to the original Wotsit.org. Their work established the foundation for Wotsup.org.
