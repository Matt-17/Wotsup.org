## Contributing to Wotsup.org

Thanks for your interest — contributions keep this resource useful. This page is a short guide to help you get started quickly.

### Who should contribute

- Researchers, archivists, and hobbyists who can improve or correct format information.
- People who find an error or have a useful additional resource (spec, sample, or reference).

### Why contribute

- Improve the accuracy and discoverability of format information for everyone.
- Preserve historical and technical details that are otherwise hard to find.

### When to contribute

- If you spot a factual error or broken link.
- If you have a primary specification, authoritative reference, or a verified file to add.

### How to start (simple)

1. Fork the repository on GitHub: `https://github.com/Matt-17/Wotsup.org`.
2. Create a small branch for your change (e.g. `fix/typo-zip` or `add/zip-spec`).
3. Make a minimal, focused change (fix, small addition, or a single new format).
4. Push and open a Pull Request with a clear description and source references.

If you prefer, open an issue first to discuss larger or uncertain changes before working on them.

### What to read first

- The repository `README.md` — quick start and build notes (for maintainers and larger contributions).
- This site's `FAQ` and `How to Use` pages — to understand how content is presented to readers.

### Reporting issues

- Open an issue on GitHub: `https://github.com/Matt-17/Wotsup.org/issues`.
- Provide: a short summary, the page or format affected, steps to reproduce, and suggested correction or reference links.

### Licensing and attribution

- If you submit content or files, include a clear license statement or attribution so maintainers know how to treat the material.

Thank you — small, careful contributions are the most helpful. If you want a hand, open an issue and we'll guide you.
