## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is Wotsup.org?

Wotsup.org is a community-driven resource providing file format specifications and programming documentation. The site contains information on hundreds of file formats, data structures, protocols, and implementation guides.

### What kind of information can I find here?

The site includes:
- File format specifications and technical documentation
- Data structure descriptions
- Protocol documentation
- Hardware interface specifications
- Implementation guides and code examples

### How do I find information on a specific format?
Note: The on-site search functionality has been removed. To find information:

- Browse by category using the navigation menu.
- Browse the `files/` and `categories/` indexes on the site.
- Use the repository and issue tracker for pointers (see GitHub link below).

If you relied on full-text search previously, a good secondary resource is the original Wotsit archive at https://wotsit.org which contains many format descriptions and may be easier to scan for older material.

### The information on a format is incomplete. Do you have more?

Everything available is published on the site. If you find more complete documentation elsewhere, please consider contributing it via our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Matt-17/Wotsup.org) so others can benefit.

### What does "unverified" mean?

"Unverified" indicates that the information has not been confirmed after reimplementation. It may be incomplete or based on limited sources. 

### What does "deprecated" mean?

"Deprecated" means the link is obsolete. An alternative link may be provided if available or a file may be included soon. If a file is "deprecated" it means it wasn't backupped. If you have a copy of the file, please consider contributing it via our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Matt-17/Wotsup.org).

### How can I contribute information?

Contributions are managed through [GitHub](https://github.com/Matt-17/Wotsup.org):

1. Fork the repository
2. Add or update format specifications
3. Submit a pull request

See our [contributing guide](/contributing/) for detailed instructions.

### What format should I submit information in?

Preferred formats include:
- Plain text (`.txt`)
- Markdown (`.md`)
- PDF (`.pdf`)
- HTML (`.html`)

Other formats are also welcome, though text-based formats are easier to maintain.

### Can I link to your site?

Yes! Please feel free to link to any page. We recommend linking to specific format pages rather than just the homepage.

### A file is in the wrong category. What should I do?

Please report it by [opening an issue](https://github.com/Matt-17/Wotsup.org/issues) on GitHub with details about the format and the correct category. We'll update it promptly.

### Is this site related to Wotsit.org?

Yes. Wotsup.org builds on the foundation of the original Wotsit.org archive. See our [About page](/about/) for more information.

For direct reference to the original archive, see: https://wotsit.org

### Can you provide personal support or identify unknown files?

Unfortunately, no. Wotsup.org operates as a reference library. We don't have resources to provide individual support or file identification services. However, the documentation may help you identify formats yourself.
