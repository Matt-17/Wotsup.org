## Trademarks, Copyright & License

Copyright to the individual files remains with the individual authors of the documents. Where known, the author's name is listed with the description of the file.

Much content originated from the original Wotsit.org archive. The original Wotsit.org site is the work of Paul Oliver and contributors; where applicable, that origin is noted on individual pages.

If any rights-holders (software companies or authors) object to their format information being made available here, we will abide by their wishes and remove the material from the site on request.

### Repository and site content

The source code, templates and site pages maintained in this repository (markdown pages, templates, styles, scripts and repository assets) are licensed under the MIT License. See the repository `LICENSE` file at the project root for the full MIT text.

### Contributor and third-party files

Many individual specification documents, uploaded files and other contributed assets included on the site retain their original licenses and copyrights. Those files remain the property of their respective authors and license terms remain in effect.

- Do not assume the repository MIT license applies to files in `files/`, `catalog/`, or other contributor-supplied assets unless that file explicitly states a license.
- Each contributed file should include a license header or accompanying metadata that identifies its license.

### If you contribute

When submitting new specifications or files, include a clear license statement in the file or in accompanying metadata so users and maintainers know the license terms. If you want the site content (the markdown page or supporting site assets you add) to be licensed under MIT, explicitly note that in your contribution.

If you're unsure which license to apply, open an issue on our GitHub repository: https://github.com/Matt-17/Wotsup.org/issues
